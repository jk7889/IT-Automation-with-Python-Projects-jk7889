# IT Automation with Python Projects - jk7889
This repository contains multiple Python projects developed by me while doing **IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate** by **Google** on **Coursera**. These projects include various **Python scripts**, their input files such as `.csv` , `.json` or `.py` files and their output files such as csv, pdf files, email alerts and more.
